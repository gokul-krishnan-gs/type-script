# 📖 Type Annotations in TypeScript

## 🧒 Kid-like Explanation

Think of annotations as **stickers on your toys** 🧸.

* If you put a sticker that says **"Car 🚗"**, you can't suddenly use it as a **Doll 🪆**.
* In TypeScript, annotations **tell the computer what kind of value a variable should hold**.

## 📚 Definition

* **Type annotations** let you explicitly tell TypeScript the type of a variable, function parameter, or return value.
* Syntax:

```typescript
let variableName: type = value;
```

## 📝 Variable Annotations 

### 1. **Number**

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
```

### 2. **String**

```typescript
let firstName: string = "Gokul";
```

### 3. **Boolean**

```typescript
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
```

## ⚡ In Short

Type annotations are **labels** 🏷️ for your variables → they tell TypeScript exactly what kind of value is allowed.
